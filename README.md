# Arcade prediction environment 

The files for environments can be downloaded from [Google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19AwuhsZdFUpyb-kHxAIzaYewCqF1pPxw?usp=sharing). Each environment contains 200k+ steps of interactions of a pre-trained rainbow DQN agent. The repository provides the python dataloader.
